# Privacy Policy
For the Turnstile iOS app Privacy Policy, see below. 

<br>
## Information I Collect

I use iCloud and CloudKit to store your information about your pens, inks, and EDC pairings to sync this information between your devices. This data is stored using your personal iCloud account and is not accessible by myself or any third parties.

## Technical Basis

Penedex uses CoreData and CloudKit to store information locally on your device and to sync data between devices.

## iCloud

Penedex stores some of your data in Apple’s iCloud service, such as your pens, inks, edc pairings, and library statistics to enable sync features between all devices signed into your Apple ID.

## Analytics

Penedex does collect aggregate, anonymous statistics, such as the percentage of users who use particular OS versions, to help improve the app. This data is stored in AppStore Connect and cannot be linked to you personally. 

## Information usage

I use the information I collect to operate and improve Penedex, and customer support.

I do not share personal information with outside parties.

I may disclose your information in response to subpoenas, court orders, or other legal requirements; to exercise my legal right or defend against legal claims; to investigate, prevent, or take action regarding illegal activities, suspected fraud or abuse, violations of my policies; or to protect my rights and property.

In the future, I may sell to, buy, merge with, or partner with other businesses. In such transactions, user information may be among the transferred assets.

## Security

I implement a variety of security measures to help keep your information secure. For instance, all communication with the app requires HTTPS.

## California Online Privacy Protection Act Compliance

I comply with the California Online Privacy Protection Act. I therefore will not distribute your personal information to outside parties without your consent.

## Children’s Online Privacy Protection Act Compliance

I never collect or maintain information on my website from those I actually know are under 13, and no part of Penedex is structured to attract anyone under 13.

## Information for European Union Customers

By using Penedex and providing your information, you authorize me to collect, use, and store your information outside of the European Union.

## International Transfers of Information

Information may be processed, stored, and used outside of the country in which you are located. Data privacy laws vary across jurisdictions, and different laws may be applicable to your data depending on where it is processed, stored, or used.

## Your Consent

By using Penedex, you consent to my privacy policy.

## Modey Bean Sticker Pack
This sticker pack does not collect any user information. The above policies that apply to the app Penedex also apply to the sticker pack Modey Bean.
